# CS5830-Assignment-6
Let’s build a FastAPI that exports the MNIST digit classification functionality for users to consume over
REST call. You can use the best MNIST model (out of 10 variants), based on the test data
performance from our last assignment. Recall our classwork where we saw how to build an API that
allows upload of a file. Users may upload the picture of a digit to your API and wait for your API to
reply back with the “digit” as the output.
